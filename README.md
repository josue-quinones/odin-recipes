# odin-recipes
The Odin Project's recipe project.

Written in:
* HTML

Goals:
- [x] Create a single webpage
- [x] Use git to handle all source control (instead of Github Desktop)
- [x] Add CSS
- [x] Improve look of homepage

Lessons Learned:
1. Use simple recipes for simple webpages
2. Read through the whole project first before writting anything out. Odin doesn't give a "This is what you will build" page example (like freeCodeCamp).
3. Using git for such a simple website seemed, at first, like a waste of time, slowing me down for little commits. I should simplify my commits to when I make a meaningful change: (a) piece of code works the way I want it to, (b) fix a typo, (c) fix a bug.
4. This was an easy, simple website to code. I had all the tools to do this before I even looked at the odin project but it was still cool to do because TOP's projects are more hands-off than the other learning website.
5. Begin with the end in mind
