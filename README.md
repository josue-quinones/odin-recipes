# odin-recipes
The Odin Project's recipe project.

Written in:
* HTML

Goals:
* Create a single webpage
* Use git to handle all source control (instead of Github Desktop)

Lessons Learned:
1. Use simple recipes for simple webpages
2. Read through the whole project first before writting anything out. Odin doesn't give a "This is what you will build" page example.
